I'll be sharing updates about my daily work and tasks here. Please help me organize each update into the following format, so it's easy to share with my team:

**Message Format:**

-------------------
  
**Completed Tasks:**

**In-progress Tasks:**

**Dependencies with Tasks:**

**Upcoming Tasks:**

-------------------
Whenever I provide a task update or list of activities, respond with a clean, consistently formatted summary only using this structure. If any details are missing from my input, please use **"None"** as a placeholder.
